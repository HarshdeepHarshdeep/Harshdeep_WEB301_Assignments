      My most favourite place in Windsor is the Riverside View of Detroit. I like the tall buildings of Detroit and the Detroit River. They all look so beautiful from the Windsor riverside. Moreover, on the riverside, we have a track to walk on and a sitting area to sit in.

      Riverside is a neighbourhood on the eastern edge of Windsor, Ontario. It is best defined by the waterfront road, Riverside Drive, which runs parallel to the Detroit River. The western boundary is approximately Westminster Boulevard, running easterly to Rendezvous Shores and the Windsor/Tecumseh town line.

      I go there frequently when I am free or I want to relax. I go there and enjoy the view. At night, the view looks amazing with the lights of the Detroit buildings. I chose this place because I like this place and I thought it had the best view of Windsor.
