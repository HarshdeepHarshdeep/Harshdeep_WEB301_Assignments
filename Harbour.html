              their site.<br>
              <b> Answer :-</b> I like the navigation bar which get converted to the hamburger while on mibile view and most content of the website get changed to the mobile view perfectly. There are many things which needs to be updated because they are not fit for the mobile view, The form on the home page get converted to the horizontal scroll to fill it, the header image on the top is small which has the name of the company, it looks different from the content image because of its size.
            </p>

              to the mobile experience.<br>
              <b> Answer :-</b>I would like to change some if the things in the website like the things I mentioned pervious like the header image and Form for the mobile. I would like to change the events page it has one section which has the blue background which looks wired on the website because all the website has the white background.
